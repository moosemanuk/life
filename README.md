# Game of Life - by John Conway (1937 - 2020)

Created by John Conway in 1970. It is a cellular automaton that obeys the following rules:

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The Game of Life is a zero player game. One simply supplies the initial state and using the rules above the game plays itself while the observer ... observes.

I tried to just dip into his tutorial and do more or less my own thing, but did lean on his teaching from time to time. All credit to Programming with Nick.
